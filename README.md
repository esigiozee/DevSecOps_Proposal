## Security must embrace a new culture

Instead of functioning as a blocker to innovation or being an outsider, security has to adapt to being an integral part of software delivery efforts throughout the entire process rather than just at the very end.

---

## Introduction to DevSecOps

DevSecOps stands for Development Security and Operations. It integrates robust security practices into the software development and deployment process.

Think of this like adding safety features to a car during the design phase rather than after it has been built and manufactured, which would make sure the final product is safe from the start.

---

## Is DevSecOps Necessary?

YES. Why?

Incorporating security early in the development process means discovering and addressing possible security flaws before they become significant ones, reducing the chance of expensive fixes and breaches after deployment.

This method not only saves money but also substantially speeds up release cycles, keeping our company competitive and secure.

---

## Benefits to the Organization

- Reduce long-term expenses by identifying and fixing security problems early in the development cycle.
- Decrease downtime by guaranteeing smoother, more secure operations while boosting client trust and satisfaction.
- Protect our brand's reputation by decreasing the possibility of security breaches that could harm our customer relationships and legal standing.
- Save costs on resource management.
- Strengthen your applications and infrastructure security.

---

## Team Structure and Size

- A small team of 5-7 highly qualified members promotes agility and effectiveness.
- A small team size reduces the complexity of communication and alignment within your team.
- With a small team, decision-making processes will usually be faster because there are fewer people involved in each decision.
